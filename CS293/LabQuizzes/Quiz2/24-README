-- You are expected to give an efficient implementation.
   Inefficient implementations will loose marks.

instructions for debugger:
Here are the step-by-step instructions:

Starting the Debugger:
   Begin by opening the file main.cpp in your code editor or IDE.
Command Line Arguments:
   When the debugger prompts you to provide command line arguments, follow these steps:
   If the program requires command line arguments, enter the required arguments at this step.
   If the program does not use command line arguments, simply leave the field blank and press Enter.
Make Target:
   The debugger will next ask for a make target. Since you don't need to specify one, leave this field empty and press Enter.
Start Debugging:
   Once the debugger is set up, proceed to start the debugging session with main.cpp opened.
